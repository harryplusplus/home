## Overview

Github: [link](https://github.com/harryplusplus/DeepReinforceLearning_FlappyBird)

- This is a machine learning project for the game Flappy Bird.
- The game is simple, played with a single key press that makes the bird flap.
- The player earns one point for passing a pipe and loses a point if the bird hits a pipe.
- The agent gains one point after passing a pipe and loses one point if it hits a pipe.
- Tensorflow was used for training, which took about a week.
- The highest score observed during training was 5 points.
- The training environment included an i5-5200U CPU, Geforce 840M GPU, 8GB RAM, Windows 10 OS, Visual Studio 2017 IDE, Python 3.6, and the Tensorflow and OpenCV libraries.
